# Perfect choice, mystery 💪🔥 — this will seriously *level up your coding mindset*.

Here’s a **mini Python project** that applies **all 5 SOLID principles** in a realistic, real-world style example.

---

## 🧾 Project: Invoice Management System

Goal:
We’ll design an **Invoice system** that:

* Generates invoices
* Calculates tax
* Saves the invoice to a file
* Sends it by email

We’ll apply **each SOLID principle step by step**.

---

## 🧱 STEP 1: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

👉 Each class should do **only one job**.

```python
class Invoice:
    def __init__(self, customer, amount):
        self.customer = customer
        self.amount = amount

class InvoicePrinter:
    def print_invoice(self, invoice):
        print(f"Customer: {invoice.customer}")
        print(f"Amount: ₹{invoice.amount}")

class InvoiceSaver:
    def save_to_file(self, invoice):
        with open(f"{invoice.customer}_invoice.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write(f"Customer: {invoice.customer}\nAmount: ₹{invoice.amount}")
        print("Invoice saved to file ✅")
```

✅ `Invoice` holds data
✅ `InvoicePrinter` handles printing
✅ `InvoiceSaver` handles file saving
➡ Each has a **single reason to change**.

---

## 🔓 STEP 2: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

👉 Open for **extension**, closed for **modification**.

We’ll add flexible **Tax strategies** without changing the original class.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class TaxCalculator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_tax(self, amount):
        pass

class IndiaTax(TaxCalculator):
    def calculate_tax(self, amount):
        return amount * 0.18  # 18% GST

class USATax(TaxCalculator):
    def calculate_tax(self, amount):
        return amount * 0.07  # 7% Sales Tax
```

✅ Add new tax systems by creating **new classes**, no need to touch old code.

---

## 🧬 STEP 3: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

👉 Subclasses must behave like their base class.

All tax calculators must work wherever `TaxCalculator` is expected.

```python
def print_tax(tax_calc: TaxCalculator, amount):
    print(f"Tax for ₹{amount} is ₹{tax_calc.calculate_tax(amount)}")
```

✅ Works correctly with both:

```python
print_tax(IndiaTax(), 1000)
print_tax(USATax(), 1000)
```

➡ We can substitute any `TaxCalculator` subclass safely.

---

## ⚙️ STEP 4: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

👉 Don’t force classes to use methods they don’t need.

Instead of one bulky `Notifier` class (with email, SMS, etc.), we separate them:

```python
class EmailSender:
    def send_email(self, customer, message):
        print(f"Email sent to {customer}: {message}")

class SMSSender:
    def send_sms(self, customer, message):
        print(f"SMS sent to {customer}: {message}")
```

✅ Each interface (class) is **focused** on one job.
➡ Cleaner and more reusable.

---

## 🧠 STEP 5: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

👉 Depend on **abstractions**, not on concrete classes.

```python
class InvoiceService:
    def __init__(self, tax_calculator: TaxCalculator, email_sender: EmailSender):
        self.tax_calculator = tax_calculator
        self.email_sender = email_sender

    def process_invoice(self, invoice):
        tax = self.tax_calculator.calculate_tax(invoice.amount)
        total = invoice.amount + tax
        self.email_sender.send_email(invoice.customer, f"Your total bill: ₹{total}")
        print("Invoice processed successfully ✅")
```

Now you can switch tax system or notification system **without changing this class**:

```python
invoice = Invoice("Mystery", 5000)

tax_system = IndiaTax()          # easily change to USATax()
email_service = EmailSender()    # could swap with SMSSender()

service = InvoiceService(tax_system, email_service)
service.process_invoice(invoice)
```

## 🎯 Full Code Together

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# --- S: Single Responsibility ---
class Invoice:
    def __init__(self, customer, amount):
        self.customer = customer
        self.amount = amount

class InvoicePrinter:
    def print_invoice(self, invoice):
        print(f"Customer: {invoice.customer}")
        print(f"Amount: ₹{invoice.amount}")

class InvoiceSaver:
    def save_to_file(self, invoice):
        with open(f"{invoice.customer}_invoice.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write(f"Customer: {invoice.customer}\nAmount: ₹{invoice.amount}")
        print("Invoice saved to file ✅")

# --- O: Open/Closed ---
class TaxCalculator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_tax(self, amount):
        pass

class IndiaTax(TaxCalculator):
    def calculate_tax(self, amount):
        return amount * 0.18  # 18%

class USATax(TaxCalculator):
    def calculate_tax(self, amount):
        return amount * 0.07  # 7%

# --- I: Interface Segregation ---
class EmailSender:
    def send_email(self, customer, message):
        print(f"Email sent to {customer}: {message}")

class SMSSender:
    def send_sms(self, customer, message):
        print(f"SMS sent to {customer}: {message}")

# --- D: Dependency Inversion ---
class InvoiceService:
    def __init__(self, tax_calculator: TaxCalculator, email_sender: EmailSender):
        self.tax_calculator = tax_calculator
        self.email_sender = email_sender

    def process_invoice(self, invoice):
        tax = self.tax_calculator.calculate_tax(invoice.amount)
        total = invoice.amount + tax
        self.email_sender.send_email(invoice.customer, f"Your total bill: ₹{total}")
        print("Invoice processed successfully ✅")

# --- Run Example ---
if __name__ == "__main__":
    invoice = Invoice("Mystery", 5000)
    printer = InvoicePrinter()
    printer.print_invoice(invoice)

    saver = InvoiceSaver()
    saver.save_to_file(invoice)

    tax = IndiaTax()
    emailer = EmailSender()
    service = InvoiceService(tax, emailer)
    service.process_invoice(invoice)
```

## 🚀 What You Learned

| Principle | In This Project                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **S**     | `Invoice`, `Printer`, and `Saver` each do one job            |
| **O**     | New `TaxCalculator` subclasses can be added easily           |
| **L**     | Any `TaxCalculator` subclass works in place of another       |
| **I**     | Split Email/SMS into separate classes                        |
| **D**     | `InvoiceService` depends on abstractions, not direct classes |

Would you like me to upgrade this example next into a **real-world version** — where we use **database + logging + error handling + OOP patterns** to simulate a real mini-backend?
